# Delivery Docket Client

This is the client for a delivery docket system. It connects to a NodeJS API as available at [smallbatch-apps/delivery-docket](https://github.com/smallbatch-apps/delivery-docket).

## Installing and running software

Clone the repository and run the following commands.

```
npm install
npm run start
```

## API Connection

API setup is described in its own readme, but once that is started, the `/src/services/` files might need to have their api url constants changed.
